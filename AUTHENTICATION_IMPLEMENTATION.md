## Overview
Successfully implemented strict authentication requirements throughout the e-commerce application. Users must now login or register before accessing any shopping-related features.

---

## ‚úÖ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Protected Route Component**
**File:** `frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` (NEW)
- Created a reusable component that checks authentication status
- Automatically redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
- Preserves the intended destination URL for post-login redirect

### 2. **Updated Routing System**
**File:** `frontend/src/main.tsx`
- **Public Routes** (no authentication required):
  - `/` - Home page (limited version)
  - `/home` - Home page (limited version)
  - `/about` - About page (limited version)
  - `/login` - Login page
  - `/register` - Registration page

- **Protected Routes** (authentication required):
  - `/shop` - Product catalog
  - `/product/:slug` - Product details
  - `/contact` - Contact page
  - `/cart` - Shopping cart
  - `/checkout` - Checkout process
  - `/orders` - Order history
  - `/orders/:orderId` - Order details

### 3. **Enhanced Cart System**
**File:** `frontend/src/lib/cart.tsx`
- Modified `add()` function to check authentication before allowing items to be added
- Shows alert and redirects to login page if user tries to add items without authentication
- Added `isAuthenticated` property to cart context
- Fixed TypeScript type definitions for all cart methods

### 4. **Updated Navigation Header**
**File:** `frontend/src/components/Header.tsx`
- **For Non-Authenticated Users:**
  - Shows: Home, About, Login, Register
  - Hides: Shop, Contact, Cart

- **For Authenticated Users:**
  - Shows: Home, About, Shop, Contact, Cart, User Menu
  - Full navigation access

### 5. **Home Page Updates**
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx`
- Added authentication check using `useAuth()` hook
- **For Non-Authenticated Users:**
  - Hero CTA buttons changed to "Login to Shop" and "Register"
  - Added prominent banner prompting users to login/register
  - Banner includes clear messaging and call-to-action buttons
  
- **For Authenticated Users:**
  - Normal CTAs: "Learn More" and "Visit Shop"
  - Full page content access

### 6. **About Page Updates**
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/About.tsx`
- Added authentication check
- **For Non-Authenticated Users:**
  - Hero CTA buttons changed to "Login to Shop" and "Register"
  
- **For Authenticated Users:**
  - Normal CTAs: "Contact Us" and "Browse Collections"

## üîÑ User Flow

### Scenario 1: User tries to access Shop directly
1. User types `/shop` in browser
2. `ProtectedRoute` component checks authentication
3. User is redirected to `/login`
4. After successful login, user is redirected back to `/shop`

### Scenario 2: User tries to add item to cart
1. User somehow tries to add item (e.g., via browser console)
2. Cart's `add()` function checks authentication
3. Alert shown: "Please login or register to add items to cart"
4. User is redirected to `/login`

### Scenario 3: Non-authenticated user visits Home
1. User sees limited home page
2. Hero buttons show "Login to Shop" and "Register"
3. Prominent banner displayed encouraging login/registration
4. Navigation shows only: Home, About, Login, Register

## üéØ Security Features

1. **Route-Level Protection**: Protected routes wrapped with `ProtectedRoute` component
2. **Cart-Level Protection**: Cart operations check authentication before execution
3. **UI-Level Protection**: Navigation and buttons adapt based on auth status
4. **Redirect Preservation**: Users are returned to intended page after login
5. **Token-Based Auth**: Uses JWT tokens stored in localStorage
6. **Consistent UX**: Clear messaging throughout about login requirements

## üìù Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Check Pattern
```typescript
const { user, accessToken } = useAuth()

if (!user || !accessToken) {
  // User is not authenticated
  // Redirect or show login prompt
}
```

### Protected Route Wrapper
```typescript
<Route path="/shop" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <Shop />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

### Cart Authentication Guard
```typescript
add: (item, qty = 1) => {
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    alert('Please login or register to add items to cart')
    window.location.href = '/login'
    return
  }
  // Add item logic...
}
```
