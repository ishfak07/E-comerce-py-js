# ✅ Invoice Feature Implementation - Complete

## 🎯 Summary

Successfully implemented a **professional, downloadable PDF invoice** feature for verified orders. The invoice button now appears in the Order History page after payment verification, and clicking it generates and downloads a beautifully formatted PDF invoice.

---

## 📦 Changes Made

### 1. **Backend - PDF Invoice Generator** (`backend/app/services/invoice.py`)
Created a comprehensive invoice generation service using ReportLab that produces professional invoices with:

- ✅ **Company branding** with gradient header
- ✅ **Invoice metadata** (Invoice #, Date, Status)
- ✅ **Customer information** (Bill To section)
- ✅ **Shipping address** (Ship To section)
- ✅ **Itemized product table** with quantities and prices
- ✅ **Subtotal, shipping, tax breakdown**
- ✅ **Payment information** (method, status, bank, transaction ref)
- ✅ **Professional styling** with colors, borders, and proper spacing
- ✅ **Footer** with thank you message and terms

**Key Features:**
- Clean, modern design with brand colors (#6D74FF)
- Proper PDF structure with headers and footers
- Formatted currency (LKR)
- Readable date formatting
- Professional layout optimized for A4 paper

### 2. **Backend - Invoice Endpoint** (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/orders.py`)
Updated the existing `/orders/{order_id}/invoice` endpoint to:

- ✅ **Generate real PDFs** instead of placeholder responses
- ✅ **Verify payment status** (only verified orders can download invoices)
- ✅ **Check ownership** (users can only download their own invoices)
- ✅ **Stream PDF** directly to browser with proper headers
- ✅ **Handle errors** gracefully with informative messages

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/orders/{order_id}/invoice`
- **Auth:** Required (JWT token)
- **Access:** Only order owner with verified payment
- **Response:** PDF file download

### 3. **Dependencies** (`backend/requirements.txt`)
Added `reportlab==4.2.5` for PDF generation:
- Professional PDF library with rich formatting
- Includes Pillow and chardet dependencies
- Installed and tested successfully ✅

### 4. **Frontend - UI** (`frontend/src/pages/OrderHistory.tsx`)
The Invoice button was already implemented correctly:
- ✅ Shows only when `payment_status === 'verified'`
- ✅ Opens invoice in new tab
- ✅ Proper icon (📄)
- ✅ Styled consistently with other action buttons

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script Created
Created `backend/test_invoice_generation.py` to verify invoice generation:

```bash
# Run from repo root:
.venv\Scripts\python.exe backend\test_invoice_generation.py
```

**Test Result:** ✅ **PASSED**
- Generated PDF: 4,184 bytes
- Location: `backend/test_invoice.pdf`
- Sample invoice created with test data
