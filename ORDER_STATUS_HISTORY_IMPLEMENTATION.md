   - `processing` - Order being prepared
   - `shipped` - Order dispatched
   - `delivered` - Order completed
   - `cancelled` - Order cancelled

2. **Tracking Status** (backend field: `tracking_status`)
   - `placed` - Order created
   - `verified` - Payment confirmed
   - `processing` - Being prepared
   - `shipped` - In transit
   - `delivered` - Completed

## üîí SECURITY & VALIDATION

### Backend Validation

1. **Ownership Verification**: All endpoints check that `order.customer_email == user.email`
2. **Status Checks**: Actions only allowed for appropriate statuses
3. **File Upload**: Validates file type (PDF/JPG/PNG) and size (max 5MB)
4. **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT token

### Frontend Validation

1. **File Type**: Checks MIME type before upload
2. **File Size**: Client-side 5MB limit
3. **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with user-friendly messages
4. **Loading States**: Prevents double submissions
