## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still see "Invalid credentials"
**Solution**: 
1. Clear browser localStorage (F12 > Application > Local Storage > Clear All)
2. Try password: `adminpass` (not admin123)
3. Restart backend server

### Problem: Admin button doesn't appear
**Solution**:
1. Make sure you logged in as admin (not regular user)
2. Check `is_staff` or `is_superuser` is true in your user data
3. Refresh page after login

### Problem: Admin page shows blank or 404
**Solution**:
1. Make sure frontend dev server restarted after code changes
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Navigate directly to http://localhost:5174/admin

### Problem: Admin endpoints return 401
**Solution**:
1. Check that token is in localStorage (`access_token`)
2. Try logging out and logging in again
3. Make sure backend restarted after auth fixes
